# MDF Data Pipeline Examples

{TODO:} Turnkey examples for MDF data analysis.

**Engineers**: It's some Python stuff. Index, process, and analyze your MDF files. Make use of the terabytes of data sitting on all those shared drives.

**Managers**: *Webscale data analytics commercial off-the-shelf opensource components*. *Edge Computing Data Analysis for Sensitive Data*.
